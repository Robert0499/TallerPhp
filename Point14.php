/* 
 PHP understands multidimensional arrays that are two, 
 * three, four, five, or more levels deep. 
 * However, arrays more than three levels deep are hard to manage for most people.

//Example
$z=array(
  0 => array (
       0 => 34, 
       1 => 35, 
       2 => 36, 
     ),
  1 => array (
       0 => 134, 
       1 => 135, 
       2 => 136, 
     )
);
