/* 
 In a matrix we usually talk about rows and columns and say 
 * that the matrix has m rows and n columns. 
 * Thus, each element is identified by its row i and column j. 
 * For example, in the matrix shown above we could say that we have 3 rows (row 0, row 1 and row 2) and 
 * 4 columns (column 0, column 1, column 2, column 3). We could say that the element of row 1, column 3 is equal to 2. 
 * In the same way we could say:
